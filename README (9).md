# **Simple Linear Regression on Tips**
## 1. Project Overview

The "Simple Linear Regression on Tips" project aims to explore and analyze tipping behavior using a dataset of tips given to waitstaff. The primary objective is to apply simple linear regression to predict the amount of tip based on the total bill. The project includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation to understand the relationship between the total bill and tips.






## 2. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project, tips.csv, contains information about tips given in a restaurant. It includes columns such as total_bill, tip, sex, smoker, day, time, and size. The dataset provides both numeric (e.g., total_bill, size) and categorical (e.g., sex, smoker, day, time) features that are analyzed to understand tipping patterns.


## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and visualize key patterns. This includes:

Histograms to understand the distribution of numeric features.
Pairplot to explore relationships between features.
Correlation Heatmap to identify correlations between features.
Pie Charts to visualize categorical data proportions.
Boxplots and Violin Plots to assess feature distributions across different categories.
## 4. Data Visualization

Several visualizations are created to analyze the dataset:

Pairplot: Examines relationships and distributions among features.
Histograms: Shows the distribution of numeric features like total_bill and tip.
Correlation Heatmap: Highlights correlations between numeric features.
Pie Chart: Displays the proportion of smokers vs. non-smokers.
Boxplot and Violin Plot: Illustrates the distribution of tips and total bills across different days and times.
Scatter Plot with Regression Line: Visualizes the linear relationship between total_bill and tip.
## 5. Data Preparation

The dataset is prepared for modeling by handling categorical variables and scaling numeric features. Categorical variables are encoded using OneHotEncoder, while numeric features are scaled using StandardScaler. The data is then split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.


## 6. Simple Linear Regression Model

A simple linear regression model is built to predict tips based on the total bill. The LinearRegression class from sklearn is used to fit the model to the training data and make predictions on the testing data. The model is evaluated to determine how well it predicts tips based on the total bill.


## 7. Model Evaluation

The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model fits the data and its predictive accuracy. Visualizations of actual vs. predicted tips are used to assess model performance.


## 8. Hyperparameter Tuning

Although simple linear regression does not require hyperparameter tuning, the project explores the impact of polynomial features to see if they improve model performance. Polynomial features are tested to capture any non-linear relationships between the total bill and tips.


## 9. Results and Insights

The analysis reveals how well the simple linear regression model predicts tips based on the total bill. The insights include the strength of the linear relationship and the effectiveness of the model. Feature importance and visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the tipping behavior.


## 10. Conclusion and Future Work

The project concludes with a summary of the findings and the performance of the linear regression model. Future work may involve experimenting with more complex models, adding additional features, or exploring other regression techniques to improve prediction accuracy. The project sets the stage for further analysis and model refinement.
